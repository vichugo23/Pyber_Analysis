# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber analysis using `Python, Anaconda, `Jupyter Notebook`, `Pandas`

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the city types. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. With this analysis I can summarizes how the data differs by city type and determine how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
