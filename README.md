# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber analysis using `Python, Anaconda, `Jupyter Notebook`, `Pandas`

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the city types. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. With this analysis I can summarizes how the data differs by city type and determine how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Summary

1) As expected, the urban cities have more use of the ride sharing services due to having a bigger population than the suburban and rural areas.
   **Adding more drivers to the urban cities would help support the never ending, high demand of rides needed in the urban cities.**
