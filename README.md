# Pyber_Analysis
Pyber analysis using `Python, Anaconda, `Jupyter Notebook`, `Pandas`

## Overview of project

The purpose of this project is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by the city types. Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type using Pandas and Matplotlib. With this analysis I can summarizes how the data differs by city type and determine how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Summary

1) As expected, the urban cities have more use of the ride sharing services due to having a bigger population than the suburban and rural areas.
   **Adding more drivers to the urban cities would help support the high demand of rides needed in the urban cities.**

2) Rural areas farea averaged about **$37 per ride** for the year 2019. While suburban areas averaged **$31 per ride** and urban areas averaged **$24 per ride.**
   The higher fare costs in rural areas could be due to farther and longer rides. It could also be caused by not having enough drivers available. More drivers should be added to support the need of rides in rural areas making the fare costs drop a bit more and in return more people would use the service.
